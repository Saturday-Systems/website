                        <p>
                            <strong>Saturday Systems was built on a simple belief:</strong> your time is too valuable
                            to waste on repetitive tasks. We help high-achievers reclaim their weekends by building
                            smart systems that work around the clock—so you don't have to.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>
                            We design automations that cut out busywork. No more pulling numbers, no more repetitive
                            reports, no more manual processes that eat up your week. Just seamless systems that
                            streamline your output so you can focus on what actually matters.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What We Do</h3>
                        <p>
                            We specialize in Go-to-Market (GTM) automation and operations engineering. Whether you're
                            scaling a sales team, optimizing marketing operations, or connecting disparate tools, we
                            build the infrastructure that keeps your revenue teams running smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sales automation and CRM optimization</li>
                            <li>Marketing operations and campaign automation</li>
                            <li>Data integration across your tech stack</li>
                            <li>Custom workflow automation with n8n, Zapier, and Make</li>
                            <li>RevOps infrastructure and reporting</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why Saturday?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Because Saturday should be yours. Not spent catching up on work. Not buried in spreadsheets.
                            Not manually doing what a system could do better. We believe in working smarter, not longer—and
                            our systems are built to prove it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                        <p>
                            We don't just implement tools—we understand your workflows, identify bottlenecks, and design
                            end-to-end solutions that actually work. Every automation is built to be reliable, scalable,
                            and maintainable. Because a system that breaks is worse than no system at all.
                        </p>
