                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>
                            A <strong>Go-to-Market (GTM) Engineer</strong> is a specialized role that sits at the
                            intersection of sales, marketing, and engineering. Unlike traditional software engineers
                            who build products, GTM Engineers build the systems and automations that help companies
                            sell and scale more efficiently.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What GTM Engineers Do</h3>
                        <p>
                            GTM Engineers design and implement automation workflows that eliminate manual busywork
                            across sales, marketing, and customer success teams. This includes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sales automation:</strong> Lead routing, data enrichment, CRM workflows</li>
                            <li><strong>Marketing operations:</strong> Campaign automation, attribution tracking, reporting</li>
                            <li><strong>Data integration:</strong> Connecting tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, and analytics platforms</li>
                            <li><strong>Custom tooling:</strong> Building internal tools for GTM teams</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why GTM Engineering Matters</h3>
                        <p>
                            As companies grow, manual processes that worked at 10 customers break at 100 or 1,000.
                            GTM Engineers ensure that revenue teams can scale without adding headcount proportionally.
                            They free up time for high-value activities by automating repetitive tasks.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                        <p>A successful GTM Engineer typically has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Technical skills: APIs, no-code tools (Zapier, n8n), scripting</li>
                            <li>Business acumen: Understanding of sales and marketing processes</li>
                            <li>System thinking: Ability to design end-to-end workflows</li>
                            <li>Communication: Bridge between technical and business teams</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Future of GTM Engineering</h3>
                        <p>
                            As AI and automation tools become more powerful, the GTM Engineer role is becoming
                            increasingly critical. Companies that invest in GTM engineering move faster, operate
                            more efficiently, and scale more predictably than their competitors.
